<p>The Internet is a network of networks. That is, computer networks are linked to other networks, spanning countries. The TCP/IP transfer protocol provides the bindings that connect all these computers the world over. </p>
<a name="Layout">Layout</a>
<p>A web page is not a printed page. That is, the guidelines that are applied to print may not apply to a web page. Avoid making the reader scan too much of the screen while reading the page. After a while it puts a strain on the eyes, and the reader may lose interest. Text should be contained within a few inches width.

<a name="Linear layout">linear layout</a>
<p>Linear layout follows a linear structure. There is a sequential link between the pages. Each page has a link to the previous and next page. The last page has a link to the first page. This format is used when you are presenting sequential information. For example, chapters of a book or slides of a presentation which require the user to read the information in sequential order. </p>
<a name="Pathnames">Pathnames</a>
<p>Absolute pathnames specify the complete path to the file from the root directory. For example, C:\mydirectory\ htmlexamples\Doc2.htm. Relative pathnames specify the location of the file relative to the location of the current file.</p>
